    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10-12 oz water (~100-110Â°F)</li>
        <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>10 oz (weigh) pre-cooked white corn flour or masarepa</li>
        <li>1 oz unsalted butter, soft + more for cooking (if browning too much, use olive oil)</li>
        <li>2 1/2 oz low moisture mozzarella, shredded</li>
        <li>Optional: 8-16slices deli-sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine 12 ounces of water and salt.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the cornflour, in 4-5 additions, to the water mixture. Using your hands, begin mixing and kneading the dough until all of the cornflour is incorporated. Let the mixture sit for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has rested, add the butter and cheese. Knead the dough for 4-5 minutes or until completely smooth and homogeneous. **try hand flattening one to check for proper moisture** If the dough is too dry, add another 1-2 ounces of water, or enough to form a supple but not sticky dough.</li>
        <li>Using wet hands, divide the dough into 8 relatively even balls. Press the balls into patties about 1/2 inch thick and 3-4 inches in diameter. </li>
        <li>Preheat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Brush the pan with more softened butter, then add the arepas.</li>
        <li>Cook on each side for 5-7 minutes, or until browned on both sides and cooked through. The arepas should be fluffy but not wet when cut into.</li>
        <li>Optionally, allow the arepas to cool for 2-3 minutes, or until handleable. Then, slice an opening on one side of each arepa, making sure not to cut through to the other side. Place a folded 1-2 slices of mozzarella cheese in the opened pocket of each arepa. Return the arepas to the same pan and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the cheese has melted.</li>
    </ol>
