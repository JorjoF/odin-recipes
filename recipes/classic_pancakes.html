    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Classic pancake recipe we all know and love, this recipe is made by <a href="https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/classicpancakes?rq=pancakes">binging with babish</a>, it is truly one of my favorite breakfast time recipes and can be made anywhere with just a handfull of ingredients.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 ounces flour</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>4 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil, plus more for the pan</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)</li>
        <li>Butter and syrup for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In one bowl, combine dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, combine eggs, vegetable oil, and whole milk. Optional: you can also add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract here. Whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Combine the two bowls and mix together gently with a rubber spatula. The batter should still be lumpy with a few dry streaks of flour. Don't overmix the pancakes!</li>
        <li>Cover the batter and let it rest at room temperature for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil in a nonstick skillet.</li>
        <li>Ladle one scoop of batter into the skillet and cook for a few minutes. Once bubbles appear on the surface and around the edge of the pancake, cook and flip for a few minutes more.</li>
        <li>Stack your pancakes up and serve with syrup and butter if desired. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
